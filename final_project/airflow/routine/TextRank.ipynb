The figure is less than last year but is still significantly higher than before the cost of living crisis began. According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which tracks the number of households in financial difficulties, 5.8 million people reported that they were struggling to pay a large bill in February 2020. The data, which gives an insight into the UK’s personal finances, showed that by January 2023, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent cost of living crisis, the number of people in financial difficulties almost doubled to 10.9 million. The regulator is reminding consumers in financial difficulty that lenders are obliged to listen to customers’ concerns. Talking to a lender about their options would not affect a customer’s credit score, it said. The FCA said 2.7 million people sought help from a lender, a debt adviser or other financial support charity in the year up to this January. Nearly half (47%) of those who sought help said they were in a better position as a result. However, worryingly from the FCA’s perspective, two in five people who had fallen behind on their bills said they had avoided talking to their lender about their finances. Laura Suter, director of personal finance at AJ Bell, said that while the overall picture was improving, it was still “incredibly tough for many households”. She said: “The figures paint a truly divided picture. On the one hand, huge portions of the population have blitzed through their savings and are now living month-to-month with no cushion to fall back on: the figures showed that 11% of people have no disposable income each month. But on the other hand, that means a very healthy majority of the population have money to spare each month – either to save, invest or spend on luxuries.” The FCA has reminded financial firms they must support their customers and work with them to manage payment difficulties. Sheldon Mills, executive director of Consumers and Competition at the FCA, said: “Our research shows many people are still struggling with their bills, though it is encouraging to see some benefiting from the help that’s available. If you’re worried about keeping up with payments, reach out to your lender straight away. They have a range of support options and will work with you to agree the best one for you. You can also find free debt advice through MoneyHelper.”', 'abstract': 'The data, which gives an insight into the UK’s personal finances, showed that by January 2023, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent cost of living crisis, the number of people in financial difficulties almost doubled to 10.9 million.\\nThe FCA said 2.7 million people sought help from a lender, a debt adviser or other financial support charity in the year up to this January.\\nHowever, worryingly from the FCA’s perspective, two in five people who had fallen behind on their bills said they had avoided talking to their lender about their finances.'}, {'sectionId': 'business', 'webPublicationDate': '2024-04-09T20:00:27Z', 'webTitle': '‘I run out of money each month’: the Americans borrowing to cover daily expenses', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/09/us-credit-card-debt', 'bodyText': 'Robin, a 70-year-old retired arts teacher from California, survives on an annual income of $14,000 in social security payments. “I became disabled and retired about 20 years ago,” she says. “My life became unaffordable then, but I’m very good at budgeting so I was able to manage. “Now, because prices have gone up dramatically – for bread, gas, everything – I run out of money each month, so I end up paying for necessities with my credit card. This has been going on for at least six months. I’m so worried. How will I ever pay this back when everything costs more and more?” Robin was among scores of Americans who shared with the Guardian that they have been borrowing more money in recent months or years than they used to, mostly in order to cover normal expenses. US consumer borrowing rose by $14.1bn in February, driven by the largest increase in credit card balances in three months. Analysts believe that the soaring cost of consumer debt for US households could affect president Biden’s chances for re-election, as for the first time on record, interest payments on credit cards and car loans are as big a financial burden for Americans as their mortgage interest. Respondents to an online callout about personal levels of consumer borrowing in the US included adults of all ages and from areas across the country, with most saying they were now struggling to repay their debts. “I can usually manage the regular things,” Robin says. “I rent a room for $450. My monthly credit card payment is $100, I like to pay it down as fast as possible. “It’s the unexpected expenses I struggle with, and they happen all the time, don’t they: new car tyres, taking my dog to the vet. I owe $2,500 dollars and I chip away at it, but what if my rent goes up? What if my 1997 vehicle needs to be replaced? “If the Federal Reserve would lower the interest rates, I’d at least be able to pay less interest on my debts. It’s so stressful, and lots of people are in this situation.” The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would leave US interest rates at 5.25% to 5.5% – a 25-year high – where they have been since July. Kenneth, 42, an apartment maintenance man from Fayette, Alabama, is feeling the impact. “I have absolutely been borrowing more than I previously did, everything costs more and wages are low in rural Alabama,” he says. What affects him the most, he says, is the high interest on his debts. “If you have to borrow money and can’t get it from a bank, you are going to pay interest rates at 35% and that’s just ridiculous. I took out a loan for $2,000 for 24 months, and I have to pay back over $4,000.” He worries every day, he says, about his ability to repay what he owes. “I’m tied to one loan for 48 months, but who can even plan for that long with the way things are now?” Donna, 63, an accountant from Oregon, was among various people who said they had been borrowing more recently because of available 0% interest credit offers. “The last couple of years, when inflation hit really hard, that’s when my credit card borrowing started, as I haven’t had a raise in three years,” Donna says. “I’m now playing the credit card swap game: large expenses such as car repairs go on a 0% card. I then carefully monitor the expiration date of that deal on a spreadsheet and eventually transfer the balance to a new 0% interest card.” Donna’s annual income of $50,000 no longer suffices, she says, to cover all her expenses, despite her frugal lifestyle. “I go camping for vacation, shop at thrift stores, eat a plant-based diet, rent out a room in my house and dog sit. “Wages aren’t catching up with costs. Handymen charge $125 per hour now in my area. You can’t make $24 an hour and pay someone $125 an hour to do your maintenance. In 2008 I made $65,000 before I lost that job. How am I supposed to get by on 15% less than I was making 15 years ago?” Donna also was among many who said they had fallen into the red recently after they were forced to pay for unexpected medical bills, despite having health insurance. A torn ligament in her foot meant she had to pay almost $10,000 towards a surgery last year, as per her insurance’s annual personal excess fees. “The 0% credit cards have been a godsend, but this year I’ve pulled $7,000 out of my retirement fund to pay off some of my debts, and over the past couple of years I’ve taken out 10% of my retirement pot to cover bills. This will be impossible to replenish. “The surgery cost $9,200, 25% of my net annual income of $36,112 after taxes and social security – no wonder I’ve had to live off credit cards and retirement savings! “It’s frightening to pull from my retirement fund just to get by, wondering how poor I’ll be when I finally do retire, if I’ll be able to maintain my home. If you’ve worked your whole life, it’s just not right.” The spiraling cost of home repairs was referenced by many, with various people saying they had been borrowing large amounts recently to fund home maintenance. Special education teacher Chris, 52, from Denver, Colorado, racked up $47,000 in loans because of unaffordable healthcare bills and essential home repairs over the past three years. In 2020 he was finally debt-free after paying off $54,000 since his divorce, he says, but then a $12,000 medical bill came in, two HVAC [air conditioning] units in his house needed replacing and some trees removing. Chris borrowed $33,000, then took out another $17,000 loan to help repay the first. “I borrowed from Peter to pay Paul,” he says, “although I increased my salary from $65,000 to $125,000 last year by teaching summer school and additional classes. Denver is pretty expensive, and I pay child support, so I ended up working a second job, driving for a ride-share company, to fight my way out of this debt. “I drive all night over the weekend to make $1,000 extra a month, so sometimes I worry about my health. I hope I can keep this up for a few more months, I still owe $14,000. Most Americans I know have a second job.” For Alex, a 44-year-old from Los Angeles who has been working in senior management positions in the entertainment industry, life in the United States has lost its appeal because of his persistent struggle with debt. After he lost his job during the Covid pandemic, it took him approximately 18 months to secure a new position. “During this challenging period, our savings were completely exhausted, by 2022 I had run out of money,” he says. Although he eventually found a job with a top salary, Alex says, escalating prices of goods, soaring interest rates and rent costs have intensified his young family’s reliance on credit cards. “My wife and I borrowed $100,000 and paid that off, but now we’re another $100,000 in the hole, to cover bills and debts, although I was on $250,000 in my last job. I was just laid off again, and the burden of our credit card debt severely limits our capacity to save and appreciate the fruits of our labour.” With a monthly rent of $4,000 for a two-bed apartment and a monthly $1,800 bill for private health insurance, the couple are currently only able to pay interest on their debts. “This reliance on credit has become a necessary strategy to ensure we can manage our day-to-day expenses and maintain the status quo for our son, so his activities aren’t disrupted,” Alex says. He was among a number of people who said they were contemplating leaving the US because of their financial situation. “Given these economic pressures, we’re seriously considering relocating to countries with a lower cost of living, higher job stability and better quality of life. We’re thinking of going to France, Spain or Italy. “The American economy is so cut-throat that people are too scared to take annual leave. The rat race is toxic, and the American dream? It’s dead for the majority.”', 'abstract': 'How will I ever pay this back when everything costs more and more?” Robin was among scores of Americans who shared with the Guardian that they have been borrowing more money in recent months or years than they used to, mostly in order to cover normal expenses.\\n“I have absolutely been borrowing more than I previously did, everything costs more and wages are low in rural Alabama,” he says.\\nI took out a loan for $2,000 for 24 months, and I have to pay back over $4,000.” He worries every day, he says, about his ability to repay what he owes.\\n“I’m tied to one loan for 48 months, but who can even plan for that long with the way things are now?” Donna, 63, an accountant from Oregon, was among various people who said they had been borrowing more recently because of available 0% interest credit offers.\\n“The last couple of years, when inflation hit really hard, that’s when my credit card borrowing started, as I haven’t had a raise in three years,” Donna says.\\n“The 0% credit cards have been a godsend, but this year I’ve pulled $7,000 out of my retirement fund to pay off some of my debts, and over the past couple of years I’ve taken out 10% of my retirement pot to cover bills.\\nIf you’ve worked your whole life, it’s just not right.” The spiraling cost of home repairs was referenced by many, with various people saying they had been borrowing large amounts recently to fund home maintenance.\\n“I borrowed from Peter to pay Paul,” he says, “although I increased my salary from $65,000 to $125,000 last year by teaching summer school and additional classes.\\nMost Americans I know have a second job.” For Alex, a 44-year-old from Los Angeles who has been working in senior management positions in the entertainment industry, life in the United States has lost its appeal because of his persistent struggle with debt.\\nAlthough he eventually found a job with a top salary, Alex says, escalating prices of goods, soaring interest rates and rent costs have intensified his young family’s reliance on credit cards.\\nI was just laid off again, and the burden of our credit card debt severely limits our capacity to save and appreciate the fruits of our labour.” With a monthly rent of $4,000 for a two-bed apartment and a monthly $1,800 bill for private health insurance, the couple are currently only able to pay interest on their debts.'}, {'sectionId': 'business', 'webPublicationDate': '2024-04-09T19:29:38Z', 'webTitle': 'Boeing whistleblower’s safety claims under investigation by FAA, reports say', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/09/boeing-whistleblower-faa-investigation-report', 'bodyText': 'Claims that Boeing knew of safety flaws in the manufacture of one of its largest passenger jet aircraft, but covered them up to speed production, are under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), according to a reports. The information came from a whistleblower inside the beleaguered US aircraft maker, and relates to the structural integrity of the 787 Dreamliner jet, a report published by the New York Times alleges. The engineer, identified as Sam Salehpour, told the newspaper that sections of the fuselage of the Dreamliner were improperly fastened together and could eventually break apart mid-flight. Salehpour said he had worked for the company for more than a decade, including on the jets in question, and claimed Boeing employed “shortcuts” in the manufacturing process intended to reduce production bottlenecks – but which ultimately compromised safety. Shares in Boeing, which has suffered a succession of recent engineering misfortunes since 346 people died in two 737 Max jets in 2018 and 2019, fell 1.6% to $178.65 on Tuesday afternoon after the FAA confirmed the investigation, Reuters reported. In a statement to the Times, Debra Katz, an attorney for Salehpour, said her client repeatedly warned the company that changes to the manufacturing process for the 787 jets threatened their integrity, but he was ignored and then transferred. “This is the culture that Boeing has allowed to exist. This is a culture that prioritizes production of planes and pushes them off the line even when there are serious concerns about the structural integrity of those planes and their production process,” Katz’s statement said. The company, in a statement, confirmed that manufacturing changes had taken place, but it insisted that safety had not been compromised. “These claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure the quality and long-term safety of the aircraft,” it said. Workers were encouraged “to speak up when issues arise”, the statement added. And the statement said that “retaliation is strictly prohibited at Boeing”. In separate remarks to the Times, Boeing spokesperson Paul Lewis said engineers had tested the Dreamliner extensively and “determined that this is not an immediate safety of flight issue”. He added that the evaluation was ongoing. “Our engineers are completing complex analysis to determine if there may be a long-term fatigue concern for the fleet in any area of the airplane,” he said. “This would not become an issue for the in-service fleet for many years to come, if ever, and we are not rushing the team so that we can ensure that analysis is comprehensive.” The FAA, according to Reuters, confirmed it had spoken to Salehpour, whose lawyers wrote to the administration’s head, Michael Whitaker, in January stating that he had made observations working on the 787 manufacturing line in 2021. The wide-bodied Dreamliner was hailed as the fuel-efficient future of the aviation industry but soon turned into a nightmare for Boeing. The fleet was grounded globally in 2013 after a series of safety incidents, including fires caused by faulty batteries. And deliveries were temporarily halted in 2021 following concerns over incorrectly sized panel gap fillers – and again last year after bulkhead pressure problems that turned out to be a data analysis error. Despite its troubles, it is still one of Boeing’s most popular aircraft, selling more than any other wide-bodied jet, the company claims. Reported issues with the 777 are also under scrutiny, the FAA said, although it did not give further details or indicate how long its inquiries will take. Whitaker did not address Salehpour’s claims against Boeing but told the Times that the company “must commit to real and profound improvements”. “Making foundational change will require a sustained effort from Boeing’s leadership, and we are going to hold them accountable every step of the way,” he said. Pressure on the aviation behemoth grew further this week when an engine cowling fell from a Southwest Airlines 737-800 jet taking off from Denver airport. In recent months, Boeing has experienced a number of similar incidents, the most serious being the inflight blowout of a large fuselage panel of an Alaskan Airlines 737 Max 9 aircraft in January. Dave Calhoun, Boeing’s long-serving chief executive, announced last month that he plans to step down at the end of this year.

Stonegate Pub Company, which has a network of more than 4,400 UK pubs and bars including the Slug &amp; Lettuce and Be At One chains, said it had not yet agreed new loans to replace debt due for repayment in June 2025. While talks with potential lenders are understood to be under way, the failure to agree a new facility by the time the company published its annual report left it with no choice but to issue an alert about its financial position. “Since the refinancing plans haven’t been executed, there is an indication that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the company and group’s ability to continue as a going concern […],” Stonegate said. It said this meant the group “may be unable to realise their assets and discharge their liabilities in the normal course of business”. Stonegate is domiciled in the Cayman Islands and ultimately owned by TDR Capital, a private equity firm that also owns Asda. It became the UK’s largest pub group with the £1.3bn purchase of Ei Group (formerly Enterprise Inns) in 2019, a deal that included £1.7bn of debt and completed just days before the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a series of nationwide lockdowns that hit the hospitality trade particularly hard. The enlarged business has been trying to refinance its debts since at least February, when Bloomberg reported that it had appointed bankers at Evercore and lawyers at Kirkland &amp; Ellis to explore its options. But despite Stonegate’s vast scale, it has yet to do so, amid tough conditions in debt markets and for hospitality groups in particular. Pubs, bars and restaurant firms have seen their margins badly squeezed between the twin pressures of rising costs and faltering consumer demand as customers’ rein in spending due to the cost of living crisis. The result has been a wave of pub closures and insolvencies in the craft brewing sector. The sector’s travails, coupled with the high interest rate environment, is understood to have made it far harder for major hospitality players such as Stonegate to refinance their debts. Stonegate has more than £3bn of debt in total and paid more than £300m in finance costs last year, including £235m of interest on its loan notes. It borrowed £638m against about 1,000 freehold properties in December but the rating agency Fitch said in January that it may have to downgrade Stonegate’s outlook if it cannot refinance £2.2bn of loans. Stonegate’s chief executive, David McDowall, who joined from BrewDog last year, said: “We have been very clear that we continue to work towards achieving our long-term balance sheet goals, with the successful refinancing of a portion of our estate in December marking a significant strategic step towards this. “Our performance gives me real confidence in the future and excitement in seeing our strategy come to fruition.” He pointed to the group’s recent trading performance in the first quarter of this trading year, showing improved revenue and profitability. In the previous year, to 24 September 2023, the group’s losses nearly doubled from £130m to £257m despite a £100m in rise in revenue to £1.7bn. Its operating profits were wiped out by costs, including a £178m negative revaluation of its brands and £300m in finance costs. McDowall pointed to an “asset optimisation plan which makes sure we have the right pub in the right location, further profit improvement initiatives, and above all our efforts to continue to support the Great British pub”. “With a summer of sport on the horizon, and the Euros and T20 World Cup fast approaching, we are looking forward to building on this momentum in the months ahead,” he said. Stonegate faced negative publicity last year when it decided to impose “dynamic pricing”, charging punters 20p more for a pint during busy periods. It was also named and shamed by the Department for Business and Trade for failing to pay more than 3,000 workers minimum wage due to what it said was a misunderstanding over how the cost of uniform was split between the company and staff.

The retailer is working with all 40 of the pasture-grazed dairy farmers in its supply base with the aim of cutting 11,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually produced by cattle burps and manure. It said giving the cows a feed supplement derived from mineral salts and a byproduct of fermented corn would help prevent the animals’ digestive enzymes from forming methane and reduce the carbon footprint of its main fresh milk by 8.4%. M&amp;S said it was setting up a £1m accelerator fund for its ethical project Plan A, working in partnership with longstanding and new suppliers to find novel ways of achieving net zero carbon emissions. One of the first projects supported by the fund will involve asking customers to donate unwearable clothes to Oxfam, alongside reusable clothing. These unwearable items will be cleaned and used to support fabric recycling, where fibres are reused and turned into new material, preventing them going to landfill. Another test project will use AI data to predict six stores’ optimal heating, ventilation and air conditioning controls to reduce energy consumption. Methane from cattle burps and manure is a big contributor to greenhouse gas emissions; globally, cows and other farm animals are responsible for about 14% of human-induced climate emissions. The government said last year in its net zero growth strategy that it expected “high-efficacy methane-suppressing products” to enter the market from 2025 and could force farmers to use them if they prove effective. More than three-quarters of M&amp;S’s carbon emissions come from its supply chain. The business is aiming to reach net zero across the entire value chain by 2040 and within its own business by 2035. Targets include doubling sales of vegan and vegetarian products by next year using 100% recycled polyester and 100% responsibly sourced palm oil by 2026. M&amp;S’s latest Plan A report reveals it is on target for most of its goals apart from plastic packaging, where it is yet to achieve its aim of 100% widely recycled packaging on food by 2022. Last year it reached 93%. The M&amp;S chief executive, Stuart Machin, said: “I talk a lot about the ‘magic of M&amp;S’ – and a key part of this is our commitment to innovation. It’s in our DNA and, along with our unique model of own brand, long term supplier partnerships, it’s how we deliver the quality and trust our customers expect from us. “By turning our obsession with innovation towards climate change and tapping into the entrepreneurial spirit of our suppliers we can turbo charge our drive to be a net zero business across all our operations and entire supply chain by 2040.

The gold price has climbed to a fresh record high today, touching $2,365 per ounce for the first time. Demand for the safe-haven metal has been pushed up by geopolitical risks, and worries about inflation, while central banks have been adding to their bullion reserves. Rating agency Fitch has lowered its rating on Thames Water’s parent company, Kemble, to just C – one step above being in default. The downgrade came less than a week after Kemble missed a debt repayment. The King has been presented with the first banknotes bearing his portrait by the Governor of the Bank of England. HSBC is selling its business in Argentina, and taking a $1bn loss on the deal due to currency volatility and the plunge in the peso. The IMF has warned that domestic shocks in emerging economies in the G20 are increasingly impacting growth in the rich world Over in Panama, a criminal trial of 27 employees working for the law firm at the heart of the Panama Papers on money laundering charges has begun. Eight years ago, leaked financial records from the law firm Mossack Fonseca sparked international outrage at the use of offshore companies by wealthy individuals to commit tax fraud and hide assets. In 2016, files from Mossack Fonseca were leaked to reporters at the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Reporters from more than 100 media organisations, including the Guardian, collaborated to investigate the 11.5m files. The firm’s founders, Jürgen Mossack and Ramón Fonseca Mora, are among those facing charges. They have previously denied any allegations against them, arguing that they had no control over the offshore companies that the firm set up for its clients. If convicted, they reportedly face up to 12 years in prison. More here: Shocks from emerging markets are having a more serious impact on growth among rich countries, the International Monetary Fund has warned. In a new report, the IMF highlights that spillovers from shocks in G20 emerging markets—particularly China—have increased since 2000, and are now comparable in size to those from shocks in advanced economies. Trade, notably through global value chains, is a key channel for shocks to propagate through the global economy, the IMF says, in Chapter 3 of its latest World Economic Outlook. The IMF points out that a pick-up in emerging markets could benefit wealthier countries, but cautions that policymakers should protect themselves from the threat of disruption. The report says: Spillovers generate a reallocation of economic activity across firms and sectors in other countries. Looking ahead, a plausible growth acceleration in G20 emerging markets, even excluding China, could support global growth over the medium term and spill over to other countries. Policymakers in recipient economies should maintain sufficient buffers and strengthen policy frameworks to manage the possibility of larger shocks from G20 emerging markets. One of AstraZeneca’s top shareholders has thrown its weight behind CEO Pascal Soriot, over the row about his multi-million pay package that comes to a boil this week. Rajiv Jain, chief investment officer of Florida-based GQG Partners, says Soriot deserves the maximum package of £18.6m which has been lined up for this year. Jain told the Financial Times: “There is a compensation issue at AstraZeneca. The CEO is massively underpaid\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009given AstraZeneca’s impressive turnaround since he joined more than a decade ago.” Shareholders will vote on Soriot’s pay at AstraZeneca’s AGM on Thursday afternoon. Soriot received almost £17m last year, taking his earnings over the last decade at AZ to around. £120m. The High Pay Centre has argued that such high earnings aren’t justifiable. Credit rating agency Fitch has downgraded its rating on Thames Water’s parent company, Kemble, after it defaulted on its debts last week by missing an interest payment. Fitch has cut Kemble Water Finance Limited’s rating to ‘C’ from ‘CC’, which is just one step above being in default. Fitch explains: The downgrade reflects Kemble’s missed payments of interest due last week and the consequent formal notice of default sent to its debtholders. Kemble has also sent formal notice of the cancellation of its undrawn £150m working capital facility to the relevant agent. The company has appointed an advisor to support restructuring discussions with creditors. Fitch adds that it would downgrade Kemble again to ‘Restricted Default’ (RD) once the grace period to make the missed payment has expired, or if the group is restructured. As reported earlier, bonds issued by other water companies are suffering a knock-on impact from Thames (see 13.12pm)… while Australian investment bank Macquarie has emerged as a lender to Kemble. The King has been presented with the first banknotes bearing his portrait by the Governor of the Bank of England. Charles received a leather-bound booklet containing the historic legal tender from Andrew Bailey at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. PA Media reports: Charles inspected the four £5, £10, £20 and £50 polymer notes – the first low-numbered note of each denomination with 01 000001 serial numbers – and pointed and smiled at the details as Mr Bailey turned the pages, showing the front and back. They were joined by Sarah John, the Bank of England’s Chief Cashier, whose signature appears on the currency, and the King gave a broad grin as he greeted his guests in the 1844 Room. The money will be issued gradually into circulation from June 5, to replace worn-out ones and to meet any overall increase in demand. Businesses such as retailers, train and car park operators, financial institutions, and ATM operators should update their banknote machines before 5 June, the Bank advises. Over in Mexico, inflation has crept up, but was lower than forecast. Consumer prices rose by 4.42% in the year to March, up from 4.4% per year in February, but lower than the 4.5% expected. Last month. Mexico became the latest major Latin American country to cut interest rates, down from 11.25% to to 11%; policymakers will be relieved to see inflation below expectations today. The firm behind the Wildwood chain of restaurants has revealed plans to shut a raft of sites as part of a major restructuring. Tasty, which also runs sites under Dim T brand, said it plans to exit around 20 loss-making restaurants after a “challenging” start to the year. The restructuring plan would see the group shut 18 of these restaurants, with two of these sites already closed to customers. The crisis at Thames Water appears to be hitting the price of bonds issued by fellow water companies. Bloomberg has spotted that the risk premium on two recently-issued bonds from the sector has increased since they started trading. This risk premium measures the gap between the yield on these bonds, compared to lending to the government. BBG says: Southern Water Services Finance Ltd. bonds have widened 13 basis points since their March 19 pricing. Northumbrian Water Finance Plc’s notes widened four basis points since pricing on March 22. That makes them underperformers among investment-grade peers whose spreads mostly narrowed in new-issue trading. Last week, Thames’ parent company, Kemble, defaulted on its debt, raising fears it could face a significant restructure or even ultimately collapse. Today, it emerged that Australian investment bank Macquarie, which has been criticised for its role in the privatisation of England’s water industry, is one of Kemble’s lenders, and could play an important role in determining its future. Before today, gold had already set a new record price for seven days running in the London bullion market, according to data from online market BullionVault. Today’s gains mean it is on track to beat the record stretch of new daily records set in March 2008. Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault, says: “While the size of gold’s price gain isn’t unprecedented, its strength is. So too is what’s underpinning this bull run, with heavy profit-taking by Western investors offset by central banks led by China continuing to hoard bullion as Chinese households also keep buying amid the country’s real-estate slump and economic slowdown.” Marks &amp; Spencer is investing £1m in tackling the methane produced by cows by changing the diet of the herds that provide its milk. The retailer is working with all 40 of the pasture-grazed dairy farmers in its supply base with the aim of cutting 11,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually produced by cattle burps and manure. It said adding a new type of feed to the cows’ diet would reduce the carbon footprint of its main fresh milk by 8.4%. The innovation comes as M&amp;S said it was also setting up a £1m accelerator fund for its ethical project Plan A, working in partnership with longstanding and new suppliers to find new ways of achieving net zero carbon emissions. Could Shell deal a major blow to the City of London by moving its stock market listing to New York instead? The oil giant’s CEO, Wael Sawan, has told Bloomberg that Shell would have to consider a shift if the gap between valuations in the UK and US doesn’t narrow. Sawan told Bloomberg’s Javier Blas last month that he is trying to fix Shell’s problems by cutting costs, cutting underperforming units, and buying back shares with free cash. Sawan added: “If we work through the sprint, and we are doing what we are doing, and we still don’t see that the gap is closing, we have to look at all options.” This morning, Sawan’s predecessor Ben van Beurden has fanned the flames, saying that the gap in valuations across the Atlantic is a “major issue” which makes it more likely that companies will consider moving their listings to New York. Van Beurden told the FT Global Commodities summit that Shell was “massively undervalued”, while deeper capital pools and more favourable attitudes towards conventional energy companies make the US more attractive than Europe. Shell is currently valued at £180bn, with a price/earnings ratio of 12.6. New York-listed rival Exxon is worth $478bn (£376bn), with a p/e ratio of 13.59, meaning Exxon is more highly valued than Shell compared to its earnings. Back in the markets, the pound has hit its highest level against the US dollar in over two weeks. Sterling is up 0.25% this morning at $1.268, the highest since 21 March – when the pound tumbled after the Bank of England left interest rates on hold but hinted that cuts were coming. Confidence among US small businesses have dropped to its lowest level in over a decade, as inflation worries dog firms. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index has slipped to 88.5 points for March, the lowest level since December 2012. This is the 27th month running when the optimism gauge has been below the 50-year average of 98. NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg says: “Small business optimism has reached the lowest level since 2012 as owners continue to manage numerous economic headwinds. Inflation has once again been reported as the top business problem on Main Street and the labor market has only eased slightly.” Twenty-five percent of owners reported that inflation (due to higher input costs and wages) was their single most important problem in operating their business, up two points from February. Over at News Corp, the Murdoch media empire, its UK newspapers are showing diverging fortunes. News Group Newspapers, which publishes The Sun, has reported a loss of £66.5m for the year to 2 July 2023, an improvement on the £127m it lost in 2022. Online reader numbers fell – with The Sun’s digital audience falling to 23.8m from 27.8m in 2022. News Group Newspapers also used to publish the News Of the World, which closed in 2011 in the phone hacking scandal. In 2022, it failed to force a deadline on potential victims to make claims against it. Today’s results show the ongoing costs of those legal claims; News Group Newspapers ran up over £50m of one-off charges, related to legal cases over allegations of voicemail interceptions (including £5.3m of claimants’ legal fees and damages), down from £128m in 2022. The picture is brighter at Times Media, publisher of The Times and the Sunday Times, whose earnings are making up for The Sun’s losses. It made a pre-tax profit of £60.9m for last year, down from £73.2m in 2022, but turnover rose to £385m from £373m. Gold is continuing to rise into uncharted territory, and has now reached $2,362 per ounce. Mexican precious metals mining company Fresnillo is benefitting from the rally in gold and silver. Fresnillo is leading the risers on the UK’s FTSE 100 share index this morning, up 4.4%, to its highest level since the start of January. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, says gold is being driven up by “a surge in haven demand” due to the turbulent geopolitical background: Iran’s explicit threat of military retaliation following Israel’s targeting of its Syrian embassy has escalated tensions, amplifying the spectre of a broader regional conflict with potentially unforeseeable repercussions. Concurrently, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine exacerbates investor anxieties. Gold, the world’s oldest safe-haven asset, has “gone on a tear this year” despite the negative pressure exerted by rising bond yields and a firmer US dollar, says Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at XM. Hadjikyriacos explains: Gold has been turbocharged by purchases from central banks, with China leading the charge as the nation seeks to reduce its dependence on the US dollar. Chinese consumers have also gone on a buying spree, searching for protection from the crash in local property and equity markets. Safe haven flows probably played a role too, amidst an unstable geopolitical landscape. In the near term, the risk is that this rally has gone too far, too fast. Momentum oscillators detect extreme overbought conditions, warning of a potential pullback in gold prices. But aside from the rally looking overstretched, the fundamentals still favor gold buyers. Gold represents only about 4% of China’s official foreign exchange reserves, so there is lots of scope for these purchases to continue. Similarly, gold can still benefit from falling yields as central banks begin to slash interest rates, particularly if the global economy loses steam. The precise drivers of the gold’s price’s surge this year aren’t quite clear. Gold commentator Ross Norman, CEO at Metals Daily, wrote last week that he was mystified by gold’s rally, pointing out that demand from institutions and western buyers has dropped this year. He suggested that algorythmic traders – buying gold because it’s gone up, fuelling the rally. Another possibility is that US mutual funds are buying gold in preparation for US interest rate cuts this year (as gold doesn’t provide a yield, it is less attractive when interest rates are higher). Norman says: Quite possibly it is a combination of Chinese and official sector buying from other routes, coupled in some sectors with mounting uncertainty over US debt and its manageability. If so, then this could be regarded as extremely “high quality” buying in that it is unlikely to be reversed ... and this rally is strong and has legs to run ... on the other hand, if it is one of those damn algos then expect trouble ahead ... after all, momentum can travel in two directions. Gold has hit a new all-time high this morning. The spot price of gold has risen to $2,365.39 per ounce, above Monday’s record high, meaning gold has now risen by 14% since the start of 2024. Gold is traditionally seen as a safe-haven in difficult times, and as a hedge against inflation. Analysts say gold has been lifted by geopolitical tensions, with war in Ukraine and the Middle East encouraging some traders to put money into bullion. Some central banks have also been adding to their gold reserves. with China’s central bank purchased gold for its reserves for a 17th straight month in March. The price of other precious metals, such as silver, have also been rising, as Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com, explains: Both metals have been in demand, particularly gold, essentially because of years of high inflation chipping away at the value of fiat currencies, which is the same reason why Bitcoin has also been hitting record levels. Up until a couple of weeks ago, silver wasn’t finding much love. But stronger industrial data from China earlier in the week pointed to stronger demand for industrial materials like copper and silver. Shares in BP have hit their highest level in over five months, after it told the City that its oil and gas production rose in the last quarter. In a trading update this morning, BP guided that upstream production in the first quarter is expected to be higher compared to the prior quarter, with production higher in oil production and operations and slightly higher in gas and low carbon energy. BP shares have gained 1.3% to 516p, the highest since the end of October. Shares have been benefiting from the increase in the crude oil price this year, with Brent crude having risen from $77/barrel at the end of 2023 to over $90/barrel today. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: “BP says it expects a strong first quarter for oil and gas trading as well as a quarter-on-quarter improvement in upstream production of low-carbon energy and oil &amp; gas. It also expects an improvement to its oil refining margins this quarter when it reports results on 7th May in the first set of earnings since Murray Auchincloss became permanent CEO in January following the abrupt departure of Bernard Looney last year. It looks like BP is poised for another strong quarterly scorecard after results in the final three months of 2023 outpaced expectations and the new CEO enticed investors by ramping up BP’s share buyback programme. Supporting BP and its rivals is an upward trend for underlying oil prices with geopolitical supply shocks and improving global demand pushing Brent crude above $90 a barrel this month, reigniting the possibility of $100 oil again in the months ahead.” An early Easter boosted consumer spending in March and gave Britain’s retailers their best month in more than two years. Prompting hopes that the retail sector might be emerging from a protracted soft patch, the latest snapshot of spending in shops and online showed the value of sales above the current inflation rate for the first time since the early days of the cost of living crisis. The monthly sales monitor from the British Retail Consortium and the accountancy firm KPMG said the value of sales was up by 3.5% in March on a year earlier. Inflation as measured by the consumer prices index stood at 3.4% in February and is expected to have fallen to about 3% in March. Linda Ellett, the KPMG UK head of consumer markets, leisure and retail, said the Easter pickup in spending pointed to the possibility of “green shoots of recovery” for retailers. Investors are losing faith that central banks will make hefty cuts to interest rates this year. Futures traders have reduced bets on how much the US Federal Reserve will cut rates this year to the lowest level since October, LSEG data shows. Traders now expect fewer than three quarter-point cuts to US interest rates this year, down from up to six cuts expected in January. Reuters explains: Fed funds futures contracts for December on Monday reflected expectations of around 60 basis points in rate cuts this year, compared to some 150 basis points that had been priced at the start of 2024. The prospect of a first 25 basis point cut in June stood at 49%, down from 57% a week ago, CME Group data showed on Monday. This repricing follows stronger than expected US economic data, such as last Friday’s forecast-beating US employment report showing 303,000 new jobs were created in March. Yesterday, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that inflation coud be stickier than forecast, leading to higher interest rates than markets expect. For the UK, traders expect the Bank of England to cut rates to 4.5% by the end of this year, from 5.25% at present. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Argentina’s currency crisis has come back to bite HSBC, as it announces the sale of its operations in the South American country. HSBC is selling its business in Argentina – which covers banking, asset management and insurance and $100 million in subordinated debt - to Grupo Financiero Galicia for $550m. But, HSBC will record a $1bn pre-tax loss on the sale, as it will crystallise losses it has been running on the Argentinian peso-denominated book value of HSBC Argentina when converted into US dollars. HSBC will also recognise $4.9bn in historical currency translation reserve losses when the deal closes. Those losses swelled by $1.8bn last year because of the devaluation of Argentina’s peso. Last December, Argentina’s libertarian government led by Javier Milei devalued the peso by about half, as part of their economic shock treatment. The sale will help fund HSBC’s pivot strategy of shifting capital to India and China. Noel Quinn, HSBC’s chief executive, says the bank is pleased to have agreed the sale of HSBC Argentina. This transaction is another important step in the execution of our strategy and enables us to focus our resources on higher value opportunities across our international network. HSBC Argentina is largely a domestically focused business, with limited connectivity to the rest of our international network. Furthermore, given its size, it also generates substantial earnings volatility for the Group when its results are translated into US dollars. Galicia is better placed to invest in and grow the business. “We remain committed to Mexico and the US, and to serving our international clients throughout our global network with our leading

'https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/09/shell-oil-list-new-york-ben-van-beurden', 'bodyText': 'Shell’s former chief executive has stoked fears that the oil company will quit the London Stock Exchange in favour of a New York listing because US investors are “more positive” about fossil fuels. Ben van Beurden used his first public interview since stepping down in 2021 to echo concerns that the £180bn company is “massively undervalued” by the UK market compared with its US listed rivals. “It’s a major issue,” Van Beurden told an oil industry summit in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Tuesday. The comments have fuelled concerns in the City that Shell will abandon the LSE to list on the New York Stock Exchange after its current chief executive signalled that it would consider the move. Wael Sawan told Bloomberg this week that Shell was looking at “all options” for its listing. The company’s share price is now at a record high of £28.40, in part due to geopolitical upheavals of recent years that have supported higher gas and oil prices. But the company believes it could be worth more. Sawan said: “I have a location that clearly seems to be undervalued.” Van Beurden admitted that Shell had considered moving its listing to the US in 2021 when the company opted to drop its dual Anglo-Dutch listing and move its headquarters to London, but had decided that leaving Europe was “a bridge too far”. He told the FT Global Commodities summit that deeper capital pools in the US, and the market’s more favourable attitudes towards conventional energy companies, had made European listings less attractive. This would increasingly be a problem, he said. European oil companies have typically had lower valuations than US oil firms. In recent years the valuation gap has widened as many European investors have adopted tougher rules on investing in fossil fuels. In response, European oil companies have moved faster to invest in clean energy alternatives than their US counterparts, which is understood to have alienated some investors still eager for fossil fuel dividends. Sawan took up the top job at Shell with a plan to cut costs and return more money to shareholders as part of a corporate shake-up designed to increase its market value. However, the strategy has put the company on a collision course with green groups which believe that includes plans to water down its climate commitments. When Shell announced an annual profit of more than $28bn (£22bn) for 2023, one of its most profitable years on record, green activists staged a protest outside the company’s London headquarters. The company signalled last month that it may slow the pace of its emissions reductions for this decade by setting a new plan to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade, compared with its previous target of 20%. Agathe Masson, of the campaign group Reclaim Finance, said the “retrograde step” showed once again that Shell had “no interest in acting for the climate”.', 'abstract': 'Shell’s former chief executive has stoked fears that the oil company will quit the London Stock Exchange in favour of a New York listing because US investors are “more positive” about fossil fuels.\\nSawan said: “I have a location that clearly seems to be undervalued.” Van Beurden admitted that Shell had considered moving its listing to the US in 2021 when the company opted to drop its dual Anglo-Dutch listing and move its headquarters to London, but had decided that leaving Europe was “a bridge too far”.\\nIn response, European oil companies have moved faster to invest in clean energy alternatives than their US counterparts, which is understood to have alienated some investors still eager for fossil fuel dividends.'}, {'sectionId': 'business', 'webPublicationDate': '2024-04-09T10:27:11Z', 'webTitle': 'Australia’s Macquarie among lenders to Thames Water’s parent company', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/09/macquarie-thames-water-parent-kemble-water-finance', 'bodyText': 'The Australian investment bank Macquarie, which has been criticised for its role in the privatisation of England’s water industry, is understood be among lenders to Thames Water’s troubled parent company. The former Thames Water shareholder could, along with other lenders, play an important role in determining the fate of Britain’s biggest water company, after its parent company Kemble Water Finance defaulted on its debt. Kemble said on Friday it had requested that its lenders and bondholders take no creditor action, but the development raised the prospect that the utility could face a significant restructure or even ultimately collapse. Macquarie’s fresh involvement, first reported by the Times, is likely to spark further controversy, after the Australian group came under fire for loading Thames Water with debt and inadequate investment while receiving big dividends during its part-ownership between 2006 and 2017. Macquarie has defended its stewardship of the utility, arguing that it invested more than £11bn in Thames Water’s network during the period, the highest per customer level of all water companies in England and Wales. It emerged last week that the group of lenders to Kemble also include the Dutch bank ING, Allied Irish Banks (AIB) and the Chinese state-owned Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). Kemble has a £190m loan that is due to be repaid at the end of this month, but the banks are expected to agree an extension. Late last month Thames Water’s shareholders refused to stump up £500m needed by the end of March, some of which was earmarked to pay the Kemble loan. Macquarie is thought to have invested £130m in Kemble’s debt in 2018 and 2020, equivalent to about 9% of the company’s debt instruments. This is not part of the £190m due later this month. A spokesperson for Macquarie said: “We manage debt investments on behalf of long-term institutional investors in a range of infrastructure companies, providing long-term financing for essential infrastructure. Macquarie has not had any control or influence over Thames Water’s operating company since 2017.” Macquarie sold its remaining stake in Thames Water seven years ago. The utility’s debt jumped from £3.4bn to £10.8bn during the Macquarie consortium-led ownership. The Australian group is known for buying public infrastructure. It can then charge fees, and receive dividends for its part-ownership, as well as enjoy any increase in the asset price. Estimates have put dividends paid for Thames Water during the Australian bank’s 11-year stewardship at £2.7bn. Days after Macquarie’s sale of its stake was announced in March 2017, Thames Water was hit with a then record fine of £20.3m linked to huge leaks of untreated sewage for offences in 2013 and 2014.', 'abstract': 'The Australian investment bank Macquarie, which has been criticised for its role in the privatisation of England’s water industry, is understood be among lenders to Thames Water’s troubled parent company.\\nThe former Thames Water shareholder could, along with other lenders, play an important role in determining the fate of Britain’s biggest water company, after its parent company Kemble Water Finance defaulted on its debt.\\nMacquarie’s fresh involvement, first reported by the Times, is likely to spark further controversy, after the Australian group came under fire for loading Thames Water with debt and inadequate investment while receiving big dividends during its part-ownership between 2006 and 2017.'}]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import json\n","\n","\n","with open(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/2차 프로젝트/NLP model/data/textrank.json\", \"w\") as f:\n","    json.dump(news_list, f, indent=4)"],"metadata":{"id":"Qh7-PMo1KMJU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
